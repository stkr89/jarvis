# Jarvis

Jarvis is a cli based workflow automation tool. It takes its input from a `yaml` 
file and performs the required tasks.  
Following are some benefits of automating your workflows using Jarvis:
- Can be shared and executed by any member of your team
- Can be added to a git repo and evolve over time
- Can work with environment variables
- Can be executed by an automation server (eg, Jenkins)
- Can keep the process consistent and free from manual errors
